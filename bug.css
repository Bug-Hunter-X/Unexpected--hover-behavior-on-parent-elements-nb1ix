The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common error: it uses the `:hover` pseudo-class incorrectly on a parent element, thereby affecting child elements unexpectedly.

```css
.parent:hover {
  background-color: yellow;
}

.child {
  color: blue;
}
```

In this example, when the mouse hovers over the `.parent` element, the background color turns yellow. This is expected behavior. However, the `:hover` pseudo-class isn't specific enough and it unintentionally changes the background color for child elements too.
